Basic Portfolio

This project was created as the first homework assignment for UNH's Coding Bootcamp. It is meant to be a personal website for me, the student, which includes a amin "About Me" page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. 

All that is required to view the site is to run it in a browser. It combines CSS and HTML, both of which were created using Visual Studio Code.
